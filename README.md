# Iris Species Prediction API

## üìò Overview
This application is a machine learning-powered API designed to predict the species of Iris flowers based on their morphological features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width). It is built using **FastAPI** and exposes a REST endpoint for making predictions.

### üåü Features
- Predict the species of an Iris flower: *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, or *Virginica*.
- Optionally return predictions as numeric labels (0, 1, 2).
- Scalable and easy-to-integrate API.

## üß† Model Training and Selection
The machine learning model used in this API is trained on the famous Iris dataset. Here are the steps involved in training and selecting the best model:

1. **Preprocessing:**
   - Data was standardized using a scaler to ensure features are on the same scale.
2. **Model Selection:**
   - Various models were evaluated, including Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest.
   - Performance was compared using cross-validation metrics.
3. **Best Model:**
   - The model with the highest accuracy and generalization capability was selected.
   - The chosen model and the scaler were serialized using **pickle**.

Both the trained model and the scaler are loaded during runtime to make predictions.

## üöÄ How to Use the API

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Endpoint: `/predict`
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Description:** Predicts the species of an Iris flower based on input features.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Request Format:
Send a JSON payload with the following structure:

```json
{
  "sepal_length": 5.1,
  "sepal_width": 3.5,
  "petal_length": 1.4,
  "petal_width": 0.2
}
```

Optional query parameter:
- `return_label`: Set to `true` to receive the species as a numeric label (default: `false`).

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Response Format:
The API responds with the predicted species in JSON format:

- **If `return_label=false` (default):**
  ```json
  {
    "species": "setosa"
  }
  ```

- **If `return_label=true`:**
  ```json
  {
    "species": 0
  }
  ```

## üìã Examples

### Example 1: Predict Species by Features
**Request:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"sepal_length": 5.1, "sepal_width": 3.5, "petal_length": 1.4, "petal_width": 0.2}'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "species": "setosa"
}
```

### Example 2: Return Numeric Label
**Request:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict?return_label=true" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"sepal_length": 5.1, "sepal_width": 3.5, "petal_length": 1.4, "petal_width": 0.2}'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "species": 0
}
```
